I am currently employed as a Data Analyst at the Office of Policy and Planning (OPP) within the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). In this role, I specialize in conducting thorough and extensive community and statewide health assessments that play a pivotal role in shaping effective public health policies and interventions. My professional interests encompass a wide array of domains, including expertise in the R programming language, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processing, adept data wrangling, precise data analysis, a keen understanding of epidemiology, a passion for machine learning, and a flair for web development.

What truly drives my enthusiasm is the end-to-end process of transforming intricate and messy data into actionable insights that have the potential to make a significant impact on public health. My commitment to these endeavors underscores my dedication to advancing public health outcomes through the power of data-driven decision-making.
